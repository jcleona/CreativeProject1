        <p>Extinguish Debt: Over the past century sovereign debt has soared on the back of purely fiat, paper currencies.
      Central banks have forced interest rates to near zero in order to make the massive debt service loads even remotely possible.  Modern governments' penchant for cheap money has spread to the citizenry worldwide.
      <p>Accordingly, because no one really earns significant interest on money any more, we have become a world full of debtors, not savers.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, only gold and silver coinage has ever proven to be a truly reliable extinguisher of debt.   All other currency is debt.
      The exercise of exchanging fiat currencies amounts to nothing more than swapping one form of IOU for another.</p>
      <!-- Power Economic Growth
      With the notable exceptions of the War of 1812 and the Civil War era. Congress adhered to a pure metallic monetary standard throughout the 19th century.  Economic historian Dr. Brian Domitrovic has commented on the remarkable performance of the American economy under the gold standard, not only during the 19th century, but also during periods in the 20th century when monetary policy keyed off the price of gold:
      The achievement of simultaneous price stability and economic growth was so outsized that we hardly recognize this kind of heady economic performance as even possible today.  Yet this is the real economic record of the gold standard.
      These observations underscore the essential role of a precious metal monetary option. -->
